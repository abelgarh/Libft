# Libft - My Custom C Library

This repository contains `libft`, a custom C library created from scratch.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to re-implement a set of standard C library functions (like those found in `<string.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<ctype.h>`) and to create other useful utility functions.

This project is a fundamental exercise in understanding C programming, memory management, and low-level data manipulation. The resulting static library, `libft.a`, can be used as a personal toolkit in future C projects.

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Use

### 1. Compiling the Library
